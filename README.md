Package named pygame is used to make Flaappy Bird game with basic functionality.
Classes:
  1. Bird
  2. Base
  3. Pipe
  
neat-python provides neural network model with wide amout of configuration.

Tip: Bird population does affect model quiet significantlly so population as high as good for NN (suggested 50)

Project is done by following other walkthrouhs to learn some new packages.
Hope I will able to make some other AI projects on my own!!
